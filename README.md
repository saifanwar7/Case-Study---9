The task involves constructing a model with the ability to categorize customer complaints based on the products or services associated with them. This categorization is intended to efficiently segregate tickets into relevant clusters, thereby facilitating a prompt resolution of the reported issues.

To accomplish this objective, the task is to work on topic modeling on the .json data provided by the company. Given the absence of labels in the dataset, the application of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is necessary. Utilizing NMF, patterns within the data will be analyzed to classify tickets into five distinct clusters aligned with the following products or services:
1. Credit card / Prepaid card
2. Bank account services
3. Theft/Dispute reporting
4. Mortgages/loans
5. Others
